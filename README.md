# DQLab Bootcamp - SQL BigQuery

This repository contains a compilation of SQL notebooks created during the DQLab Bootcamp (BigQuery track).  
The exercises are based on the **Maven Analytics Pizza Challenge dataset** (with modification by DQLab).

---

## Project Overview

The notebooks explore SQL concepts using **Google BigQuery**, focusing on building a strong foundation in query writing and analysis.

Each notebook contains structured explanations, example queries, and practical “Quest” problems that simulate real-world analytics tasks.
